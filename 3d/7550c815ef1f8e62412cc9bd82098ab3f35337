Still cannot make the example `litellm/chat.php` work without API key for litellm - but that's mostly me struggling with litellm

I'm fixing usage of LiteLLM with ot without apikey (defined by master_key config entry). I'll push it as soon as my network connection allow it from my high-speed train!

I rebased and squashed the commits into one to be able to use `gh` tool, I hope you don't mind @welcoMattic 😄

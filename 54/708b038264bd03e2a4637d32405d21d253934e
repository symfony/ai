Hi @chr-hertel

This PR is fixed with your reviews, the `add` method has been improved with `array_push` (better than a loop, I agree) 🙂

Rebase done 👍🏻

The unit tests are failing due to zip archive, nothing to do with the code.

@OskarStark @chr-hertel Is it okay for you if we delay the approval/merge of this PR?

I might have an idea to support more sorting algorithms without adding complexity to the API.

Ok, should be better (thanks to `match` 😄 ), ready to review when you have time @chr-hertel @OskarStark.

PS: Sorry for the previous ping.

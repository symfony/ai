# Migration to External MCP SDK

This bundle has been updated to use the external `mcp/sdk` package instead of the internal `symfony/mcp-sdk`. 

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Migration Complete**: The MCP Bundle has been successfully adapted to work with the external `mcp/sdk` package.

## Major API Changes

1. **Namespace changes**: `Symfony\AI\McpSdk` ‚Üí `Mcp`
2. **Interface changes**: Many interfaces have been renamed or restructured
3. **Architecture changes**: The new SDK uses a unified `Registry` instead of separate tool executor/collection interfaces
4. **Handler changes**: Both notification and request handlers now implement `MethodHandlerInterface`
5. **Transport changes**: `StdioTransport` constructor expects raw resources instead of Symfony console I/O

## Implementation Details

The bundle has been completely adapted with the following changes:

1. ‚úÖ **Service definitions updated**: Using new `Handler::make()` factory and `SymfonyRegistry`
2. ‚úÖ **Registry system implemented**: Custom `SymfonyRegistry` bridges Symfony services with MCP Registry
3. ‚úÖ **Transport integrations updated**: `StdioTransport` now uses raw resources (STDIN/STDOUT)
4. ‚úÖ **Tests updated**: All tests passing with new architecture
5. ‚úÖ **Demo tool updated**: Implements new `ToolExecutorInterface` with `CallToolRequest`/`CallToolResult`

## New Components

- **`SymfonyRegistry`**: Extends MCP Registry to work with Symfony services
- **`McpRegistryCompilerPass`**: Automatically registers tagged `mcp.tool` services
- **Updated tool interface**: Tools now implement `ToolExecutorInterface` from external SDK

## Test Status

‚úÖ **All tests passing**: 10 tests, 24 assertions - the bundle is fully functional.

## What's Still Needed / Future Improvements

The core migration is complete, but the following could be considered for future enhancements:

### Potential Improvements

1. **üîß Enhanced Tool Registration**
   - Consider supporting the new `#[McpTool]` attribute for automatic tool discovery
   - The external SDK provides attribute-based tool registration that could supplement the service-based approach

2. **üìù Documentation Updates**
   - Update bundle documentation to reflect the new `ToolExecutorInterface` requirement
   - Add examples of creating tools with the new SDK interfaces
   - Document migration path for users upgrading from old internal SDK

3. **üß™ Extended Test Coverage**
   - Add integration tests with actual MCP client communication
   - Test error handling scenarios with malformed requests
   - Test tool registration with various interface combinations

4. **‚ö° Performance Optimizations**
   - The current Registry wrapper creates callables for each tool - could be optimized
   - Consider lazy loading of tool services for large applications

5. **üîÑ Additional Capabilities**
   - Support for Prompts and Resources (currently only Tools are implemented)
   - Integration with the Discovery system from external SDK
   - Support for server capabilities customization

### Breaking Changes from Previous Version

- **Tools must implement `ToolExecutorInterface`** from `mcp/sdk` instead of old interfaces
- **Method signature change**: `call(CallToolRequest)` ‚Üí `CallToolResult` instead of old signatures
- **Return format change**: Must return `CallToolResult` with array of `Content` objects
- **No backward compatibility**: Old tool interfaces are not supported

The bundle is production-ready but these enhancements could be added based on user needs.

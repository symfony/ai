Consider this first implementation as basic bridge for basic usage. It could be improved during the hackathon by:

- Adding examples (tool calling, image, etc)
- Add guard about model presence (using "Get model" endpoint https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/api-reference/#available-dmr-endpoints) to avoid calling a non-present model

oh, that's due to #535 and not using the components from the branch but via composer install, right?

Indeed, I'll take a look.

I feel like this can be easily fixed with https://github.com/symfony/ai/pull/552/commits/93464f6a3e6e4db4520bf155852cd4525402e63a

But I get a infinite loop
https://github.com/symfony/ai/actions/runs/17674610626/job/50233715432?pr=552

I assume it's because of https://github.com/symfony/ai/issues/527 cc @chr-hertel

Not sure if we can do something until...

What do you need to be able to test? More doc about setting up Docker Model Runner?

I forgot to install one model and ended up with:

If possible, it would be nice to throw a `MissingModelException`, if we can check that beforehand. Can be a follow up PR

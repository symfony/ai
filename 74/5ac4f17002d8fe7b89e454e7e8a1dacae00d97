On my computer, my fork was a bit outdated. I ran `cd examples && composer up`.
And when I wanted to run the examples, I got an exception, because a class (Clock IIRC) has been moved.

Explanation:

* my current example expected code a version 1234
* `composer up` grab code from main at version 1255
* 💥

With this patch, we ensure everything is sync.

It saves one step! Better onboarding

yes, agree as well, but for the Platform component you'd need to replace more code - or keep it for now and only take action on store

Yes indeed. I will continue this PR when I get back home on Thursday.

I will prepare a PR to add unit tests for the code parts using the lib. So we can merge my PR first, then rebase and check the CI üëç

Merged Oskar's tests, rebase please :)

Thanks. Rebased, squashed and tests are ok.
I noted there are `InvalidArgumentException` classes in `ai-platform`, `agent` and `store`.
As `agent` and `store` depend `on ai-platform`, do you think interesting to remove redundant classes? (not here, but another PR)

From a design point of view my understanding was that we want exceptions clustered per package - rather a best practice than tho.
how does `symfony/symfony` handle this? throwing exceptions of a dependency feels a bit odd to me - it's an extra dependency and not explicitly design for that :thinking:

Yes per package, imagine you are just using one package, the exception will not be available.

Can that be done separately?

Yes should be a follow up PR, maybe create an issue to not forget?

@chr-hertel
Could you have a look?

Do you mean we should register such classes as services individually manually?
I tried to register them dynamically, and this is why the attribute exists.

Integration with the demo app is already done, and I was awaiting this PR's merge so that I could follow it up with another PR that would contain these changes. @OskarStark earlier suggested trying to make the respective changes in the profiler, and this is why I didn't commit/push the changes that pertain to the demo app to keep the surface area of the changes small.
I tried testing the demo app with **Ollama**. Though everything worked fine, the token usage was obviously empty since the said bridge doesn't have any output processors for token usage yet, which I intended to add as well.

@chr-hertel
I made the following changes in the latest commit:
- Removed the attribute to tag token usage output processors
- Registered the token usage output processors as services manually inside the AI bundle
- Added token usage information to the documentation

Would it make sense to follow this PR up with another one to add the token usage stuff for demo and probably profiler as well, to keep this PR small?

Multiple small PR would be great to unlock other TokenOutProcessor PR too :)

@chr-hertel
Could you have a look at the latest changes and let me know what you think?

Looks quite good to me

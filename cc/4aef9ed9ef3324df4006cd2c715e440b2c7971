so the thinking model would be that the package has bridges, that provide extensions, right? just to make sure i get it right :laughing:

and we keep the `Bridge` namespace and package names, like `symfony/ai-monolog-mate`?

@chr-hertel yes i would keep the package-names, the namespaces, and also the tooling - so it would fit into the structure of this repo BUT would be clearer for the user that an extension extends the tool

I am still for Symfony/ai-monolog-mate-extension

I agree that we don't do this for the others, but store tool and platform are common terms, while mate is some kind of unknown.

but only unknown _yet_ :laughing:

no strong opinion here

@OskarStark like the extension postfix - would like todo that because i think that would make the intention clearer

@OskarStark @chr-hertel added the suffix :) hope i have also changed all the things needed for the CI - but at least its green 😂

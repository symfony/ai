Looking at this growing (and i guess it's necessary), and seeing failover going into a separate bridge, and that `symfony/string` check, i wonder if this should be a dedicated bridge as well - WDYT?

Yes makes sense

Make sense, what about the name? Was tempted to call it `Cache` 😅

you mention ` + fix for storage` in the PR title, is it still true? If no, please update, if yes, can we extract to not mix things here? Thanks

The fix is part of the PR, the first goal of this PR was to fix the storage aspect but as we also introduce the "split" for the platform, it's more a "new feature" to be honest, I'll update the name of the PR 😅

I'll take a look at your comments 👍🏻

The CI is failing like the one on `main`, not related to the tests.

Lets fix it in `main` before merging this PR, it is related to something merged recently in symfony/symfony regarding phpdocumentor

Rebase unlocked, CI fixed in

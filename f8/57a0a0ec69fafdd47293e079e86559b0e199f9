Hey @OskarStark
I checked the PR for OpenRouter and saw, that `"symfony/ai-generic-platform": "@dev"` is missing in the composer.json, right? Also checked LMStudio and I think the dependency is missing in all packages that use the new Generic completions integration. Or have I overlooked something?
Regards,
Tim

Do I need to adjust anything, or is it okay as is?

From the code POV it looks ok, lets wait for the review of @chr-hertel, but please do a proper rebase, we cannot merge it, when a Merge-Commit is present (see Fabbot CI failure)

Thanks but I don't think I can manage a clean rebase myself! When I rebase to the upstream, it always includes the commit history in the pull request. I don't think that's desired. Any help would be appreciated :-)

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:symfony/ai.git && geit fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/main` in your branch does not work?

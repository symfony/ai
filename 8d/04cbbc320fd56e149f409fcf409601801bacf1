Hey @sonnymilton, thanks for looking at this, didn't realize so far that there's that nested options thingy ...

So goal is to keep the `$options` array in the `invoke` call a flat array and do the nesting for the user, right?
I agree since this unifies for example how `temperature` is handed over when switching for example between openai and ollama

@chr-hertel
Yes. The idea is to keep the contract as a flat `$options` array.
Then each provider’s client is responsible for shaping the outgoing request to match its API (e.g. the **Gemini** client already does this by wrapping options into the appropriate structure and lifting special fields to the top level).

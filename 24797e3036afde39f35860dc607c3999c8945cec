INstead of an image, could you paste the mermaid code for the diagram to the PR header?

I did consider that, but not sure if it's a good idea since the LLM calls don't show up in the profiler when using streaming. Maybe you know if there's something to do about that?

oh, wasn't aware, but true, i think having that profiler insights is important for the demo - let's keep it as a separate one - good call :+1:

Did the suggested changes

Created an issue for the profiler bug and I have an idea for the fix too, if it'll work, then maybe we could use streaming for all demos instead of this separate one

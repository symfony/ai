Also, is there a reason to ignore
```
message: "#^Method .*::test.*\\(\\) has no return type specified\\.$#"
```
rather than adding `void` return type? since you require recent version of phpunit and php.

The failure https://github.com/symfony/ai/actions/runs/20429872316/job/58698047458?pr=1241 seems random so I think this is ready to be reviewed @OskarStark :)

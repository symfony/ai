Quick update: I added support for providing a custom ModelCatalog in the factory, so the Albert platform configuration is now consistent with the other platforms.

Also, regarding the model list: I saw that the alignment work was already merged, so that part is resolved (#839).

One open point from the original description: Albert currently uses `base_url` while some platforms use `host`. Do we want to standardize on one naming style across platforms, or keep it platform-specific for now?

Related to that: should we provide a default `base_url` for Albert (e.g. https://albert.api.etalab.gouv.fr/v1), or do we prefer requiring it explicitly in configuration?

See #839 and #840 for other items - i think base_url vs host or default is fine like this

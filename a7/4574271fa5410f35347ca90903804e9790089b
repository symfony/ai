@chr-hertel do we need the `$options` on the `Model`?

i am so torn üòÜ i love the changes in the examples. i hate the arrays in the `ModelCatalog` - but we discussed that already. could be a yaml as a follow up.

just one thing, that is personally value, is the code completion by the IDE, e.g. `Claude::SOMETHING` - i won't miss the classes, but will def miss the constants

Yes follow up is fine

we could for sure generate such things, but we need to provide BC for it and TBH how often do you need to write such things. Another idea could be Symfony IDE plugin or so, or can we generate something for phpdoc which helps autocomplete?

Not sure, why this was missing while I rebased the branch... ü§î

https://github.com/symfony/ai/pull/640/commits/f888ee386092c4acebf6bab59fea55cc7aaec59a

This should fix **Anthropic** and **Bedrock**, as they both are using the **Claude** class, which is not nice and I fixed in
* https://github.com/symfony/ai/pull/687

**ElevenLabs** should be fixed by
* https://github.com/symfony/ai/pull/686

replicate, anthropic, elevenlabs and azure look good now - only bedrock is failing:

Will have a look at bedrock, but cannot test it on my own üëçüèª

CI is failing:
```
An error occurred while setting up the "opensearch" store: Empty reply from server for "http://127.0.0.1:9200/symfony".
```

Looks like OS is too slow during its boot phase, I'm looking for a solution 🙂

@OskarStark It's fixed, sorry for the extra delay and the X notifications about the CI 😅

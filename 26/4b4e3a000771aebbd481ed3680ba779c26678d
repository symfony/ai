Why do we want to drop 6.4?

I don't think there is a big burden to support it and it it a huge benefit for adoption of we keep it.

Or am I missing something?

If you're not able to upgrade to a non-LTS version of Symfony, you will probably not be able to use Symfony AI, which is not stable yet (and probably not before the release of 7.4 LTS), you will probably not be able to upgrade Symony AI frequently which is going to be needed as the space is changing fast.

> the CI failures look related

yes, but I think this is due to the fact that not all Symfony components allow 7.4|8 ? just my guess

No, it's because you're pinning to unstable Symfony branches while requesting stable dependencies.

Ok, so we can only merge this, once 7.4 and 8.0 are released?

No, you'll have to lower the minimum stability to dev. Either globally for the project (as we do on symfony/symfony) or on those two CI jobs.

:-1:  from me (at least until 7.4 is out). This will change a one-week proof-of-concept to a bigger "upgrade symfony" project for many companies ‚Äì assuming that companies prefer LTS _(yet are fine running `symfony/ai@dev`)_.

@derrabus I now use the proposed minimum stability and the 7.4 build is passing, but the 8.0 one not ü§î

@OskarStark Read the error message. ‚úåÔ∏è You need to run the Symfony 8 workflow on PHP 8.4.

My heart always feels a bit sad when exposing stuff, but i think your use-case is valid :+1:

Regarding the interface I'm a bit torn but currently in favor of adding it as well. :thinking:

I was hesitating about it because:
- Symfony codebase itself currently never use AgentInterface::getModel
- Some people might implements an `AgentInterface` with multiples models (based on the option ?)

Do you confirm I should update the interface in this PR @chr-hertel or you prefer another opinion ?

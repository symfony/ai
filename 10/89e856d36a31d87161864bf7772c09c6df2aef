Rebased & added docs.

About PHPStan error, not sure what to do with it, it's about this 3rd parameter: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/7.4/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Core/Authorization/AuthorizationCheckerInterface.php#L27

> About PHPStan error, not sure what to do with it, it's about this 3rd parameter

my first thought here would be to ignore the error in the `phpstan.dist.neon` with some kind of comment that we can drop it one day - when dropping Symfony 7.4 support?

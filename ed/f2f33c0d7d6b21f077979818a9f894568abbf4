Please rebase on main and adopt the changed test style, switching from `#[Test]` attribute to `test` method prefix, see #214.

I rebased, changed the test and renamed the class. Anything more :) ?

Great I will fix phpstan, rebase and we can get this merged. The new pull request for the model usage can follow after that :)

And that unit test for `Symfony\AI\Platform\Bridge\Ollama\Ollama` please :)

Sorry for the repetetive pushes. fabpot had some remarks I was not aware of. Especially this is confusing in the config:

At one part the suggestion is to have a FQCN on global functions and in another place they don't.

Apart from that I should not have any open tasks on this pull request

We only use the one which have an optimized usage afterwards, but yes, sometimes its hard to guess :-)

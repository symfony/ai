I've completed the implementation of the `remove()` method for the Typesense store. Here's what was done:

**Implementation (commit f03214f):**
- Added `remove(string|array $ids, array $options = [])` method
- Handles both single ID (string) and array of IDs
- Validates options parameter (throws exception if non-empty)
- Makes individual DELETE requests to Typesense API for each document

**Tests (commit f03214f):**
- Single document removal
- Multiple documents removal
- Empty array handling
- Error response handling (404)

**Documentation (commit ec24ad3):**
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with new feature entry

The implementation follows the same pattern as other HTTP-based operations in the Typesense store and is consistent with the Pinecone reference implementation.

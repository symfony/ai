Yes, need to work on the changelog and tests, won't update the changelog until the tests are fixed ðŸ™‚

Regarding the documentation, the current state is that `InitializableStoreInterface` is the interface for initialization, should we list the change to `ManagedStoreInterface` or just change the name in the file? ðŸ¤”

Just change the class name in the changelog as we haven't released yet

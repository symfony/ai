Let's zoom a bit out here, for two reasons:
1. doesn't ollama caching already?
2. if we want to have it user land, why only ollama?

Ollama does a "context caching" and/or a K/V caching, it stores the X latest messages for the model window (or pending tokens to speed TTFT), it's not a cache that returns the generated response if the request already exist.

Well, because that's the one that I use the most and the easiest to implement first but we can integrate it for every platform if that's the question, we just need to use the API contract, both Anthropic and OpenAI already does it natively 🤔

If the question is: Could we implement it at the platform layer for every platform without relying on API calls, well, that's not a big deal to be honest and we could easily integrate it 🙂

What do you think about having it as decorator `CachedPlatform` or similar?

I like the idea of `CachedPlatform`, looks and sound like `HttpCache`, I'll rewrite it 👍🏻

IMHO, the token usage must be added in a separate PR, it requires to update existing platforms to send the informations in the result.

Out of the current scope for this PR IMO.

@junaidbinfarooq I created an issue for the `TokenUsage` DTO 🙂

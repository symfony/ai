That is really an interesting idea, since the PSR 6 cache has quite some implementations. I wonder tho if we would still recommend to use that only in testing or development. I would assume that it doesn't scale well with a lot of documents since the search needs to happen in PHP runtime with all documents loaded, right?

Not sure about the performances side, IMO, that's not a big problem (we already use the Cache layer from Sf for heavy operations, that's not a big deal), If you fear that it can impact applications, we can recommend to use it only in dev/test envs, it's just a documentation concern ðŸ¤”

The configuration in the bundle package has been added (better to do it now than in another PR ðŸ˜„ )

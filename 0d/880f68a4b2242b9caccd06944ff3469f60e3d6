Not sure why PHPStan fails on 8.4 -- is it a linking issue? The argument it's complaining about seems fine to me.

How do we feel about the rest? < 8.4 is going to fail because of the interface properties. Should we support 8.4 or should I solve this with getter methods on the interface instead of interface properties to accommodate for the earlier versions?

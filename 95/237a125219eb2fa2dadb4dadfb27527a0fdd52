> Maybe I missed something, but can't you use LiteLLM bridge directly?

@OskarStark i removed that thing in favor of the generic-bridge - i wonder now if that was clever if there are litellm quirks

@colorfield are you aware of more quirks of Litellm or is it only about that structured output tool call vs content mix up?

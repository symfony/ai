Yes, let's do this to unblock the usage for now - we can work on a slimmer config as a next step.

Conflicts after merging #94, but rebase should do the trick hopefully

@chr-hertel comment addressed, I made the same changes on Agent configuration.
Docs and demo are also fixed.

Follow up ideas:
- Generic model classes should be possible
- Is the model a service? feels a bit odd since it looks like a DTO but also carries configuration
- A Platform usually defines already a set of models - why bother to configure it explicitly!?

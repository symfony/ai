Well, that's a weird one, no changes on my side and the class is not found by the bundle, what the funk is this behavior? 🤔

@OskarStark Tests are failing in `AiBundle` due to the lack of the package, can't be fixed before its published for these ones 🙁

Try to add a path repository to ai bundle composer.json, but AFAIK the `build-packages.php` script should do exactly this 🤔

@OskarStark Regarding the issue with `AiBundle`, it looks like the `build-packages.php` can't be called (it can't find the autoloading file) during unit tests, could this be related to the issue? 🤔

Can you add a path repository for failover platform to composer.json of the AI-Bundle? Thanks

Path repository in composer.json should not be needed after the rebase

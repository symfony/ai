Ah yes, tested the cloud version and it comes with an existing database, hum, one solution might be to add a `forceDatabaseCreation` (name open to debate ðŸ˜„ ) option in the `initialize` method, this way, if the option is set to `true`, we create the database, otherwise, we "expect" that it exist ðŸ¤”

Small update here @chr-hertel @OskarStark, I removed the `DroppableStoreInterface` following the discussion in #285, it's better to do a "big" PR to updated than introducing something that will be removed for clarity later.

I just rebased the branch against `main`, @OskarStark, I will work on renaming the env variable in a new PR ðŸ™‚

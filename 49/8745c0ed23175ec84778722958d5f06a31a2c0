So I would have to use `StoreInterface $chromadbBlogStore` instead of `StoreInterface $blogStore`?

What about registering both? The long and the short version? I would argue, that this is not really common use case, right?

Also docs would need an update

@chr-hertel Yes

@OskarStark Yes, agree on the fact that it's not a common approach (even if it can be used when you're migrating from one to another), registering both is fine for me if @chr-hertel agreed on it üëçüèª

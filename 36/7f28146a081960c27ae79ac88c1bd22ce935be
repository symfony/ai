Hi @bigdevlarry, thanks for jumping on this! :)

Since we release the v0.1 we need to now also track changes like this in the changelog, so please add this as entry to the changelog of the bundle.

Please use 0.2 as headline in the changelog.

Please create an UPGRADE.md file where we show a before and after example. This is helpful for humans, but also for AI tools when upgrading the users codebase

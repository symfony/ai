Looks really good - thanks @smnandre! Needs a rebase and Oskar's comments - good to merge than

Done :)

to keep the flow straight forward, I would love, if you could squash your commits and create a PR on the original llm-chain lib. We can cherry-pick then afterwards

Wait, so .. i must have two separated forks, work on AI, rename paths but also concepts from one to the other, open the PR on LLM, and then it's done here ? :|

Could we ease that process a bit?

(rebased and squashed here)

A right, you must rename the namespaces and so on, didn't thought about this. Ok then nvm, let's merge it here

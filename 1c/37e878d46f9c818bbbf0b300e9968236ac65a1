alright, let's go - will add some comments on #254 as well - building on top of this i guess.

@chr-hertel Yes, the idea is to start by splitting the chat, from that point, we can work on the storage part then handle the final implementation 🙂

@OskarStark @chr-hertel Regarding this PR, I can't fix the tests / quality as the `ai-chat` repository is required, is there any solution to fix/validate them before merging or should we wait until its merged? 🤔

I had the same problem for a new package in the brave tool PR.
I am fine merging as is and taking care of the CI afterwards, but immediately 👌🏻😝

Ok, no problem 😅

Let me know when you have time to review the PR and merging it, on my side, most of the work is done, I can work on other PRs until you merge it.

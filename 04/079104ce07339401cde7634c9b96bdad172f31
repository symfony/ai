the need for extension is not really ClickHouse specific, is it?
I think we need an extension point somewhere here anyways. a low level mapping/hydration thingy.
with #18 we have a similar topic i'd say - and with #158 we also have an issue of making too many assumption. totally open for ideas. :)

Indeed 👍🏼 The current StoreInterface is a bit limited, but I eventually managed to do what I need to POC something.

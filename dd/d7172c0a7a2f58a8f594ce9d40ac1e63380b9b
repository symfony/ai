Hi @chr-hertel 👋🏻

I would have inverted the condition by registering the normalizer in the condition related to the `cache` platform (this remove the lines from `services.php`) in `processPlatform...` method 🤔

yea this is not super intuitive, but mostly how we do it right now - for now it's more consistent, but will look at this later again to optimize a bit how we handle that bridge specific stuff - similar to #1448

@OskarStark thanks for the reviews. What is exactly the problem of the Fabbot pipeline? I have to change the PR header or description.... but in which way? https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/pull_requests.html#make-a-pull-request Do you have a hint for me? I don't get it...

I think it's about the actual comment of the PR
<img width="656" height="314" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d460bd7-e58a-4936-898b-c96d2c31e932" />

fixed it, but Fabbot still not happy :man_shrugging:

Hey @chr-hertel
just changing the PR do not retrigger the action. I add some error code handling, retrigger the action and it looks right now. Thank you...
Regards,
Tim
